Mobile service that helps management of Medication / Health Supplements intake

---

### Intro 

* Interest in medicines and health supplementary foods is increasing day by day.
* According to the Korea Health Supplements Association (KHSA), the domestic health Supplement market formed 4.6 trillion won in 2019.
* However, the number of reports of side effects from their misuse is increasing every year.
* In particular, health supplements can be purchased without a doctor's prescription, so it is difficult for the general public to access information on the prohibition of medical use between drugs or health supplements.
* So we developed a service that helps safe intake of medicines and health supplements.

### Functions

##### 2. Use OCR to register / edit conveniently
* You can register medicine by taking a picture of the prescription or medicine bag.
* You can register supplements by taking a picture of the product.
* We also provide a name search function for unrecognized drugs.
* When OCR recognition has done, we recognizes medicine and disease information from the picture and stores it on the device.

##### 3. Probability model-based disease estimation
* About medicine, in case of drug bag or some prescription, there's no information about disease. 
* So we developed disease estimation algorithm that uses "Prescription records by pharmacology group" provided by Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service
